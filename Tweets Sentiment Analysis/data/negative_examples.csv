PeterSchiff,7/28/22,886592,,8590,"if #donaldtrump were still president and u.s. gdp just contracted for a 2nd consecutive quarter, there's no way the media would not be reporting it as a #recession. instead, the left-wing media is spreading #democratic propaganda to redefine recession to pretend we're not in one."
PotatoSmug,7/25/22,20681,united states,5794,you want to see propaganda in action? gaslighting taking place in real time?

PeterSchiff,7/29/22,886585,,4278,"it's likely that the u.s. economy will never be in a #recession again. if we no longer have an objective standard to define one, government will always be able to find some excuse to claim the economy isn't in one. ironically, we're not in a recession now. we're in a #depression."
PeterSchiff,6/27/22,886611,,4246,"anyone thinking this #recession will be mild doesn't understand recessions. the longer interest rates are held too low during a boom, the more mistake that must be corrected during a bust. since rates have never been so low for so long, this recession will be the most severe yet."
PeterSchiff,7/24/22,886605,,4140,"according to sec. yellen, regardless of how of how many quarters #gdp falls, an economy creating 400k jobs per month isn't in a #recession. what if those are 2nd or 3rd jobs for people struggling to pay bills, or retirees going back to work as #inflation destroyed their incomes?"
PeterSchiff,10/3/22,886568,,3921,"we've finally reached the inflection point. governments can either keep running budget deficits, or they can fight #inflation, but they can't do both. plus, they can't win an inflation fight without causing a financial crisis and #recession worse than those they caused in 2008."
zaddy9115,7/25/22,251,"austin, tx",3887,"this is so tone-deaf. when people have to work multiple jobs to pay the bills, it is not a “strong economy.” #recession https://t.co/jpqdsoshqw"
PeterSchiff,10/4/22,886568,,3575,the u.n. has urged global central banks to stop hiking interest rates to avoid a global #recession. why didn't the u.n. warn central banks that qe &amp; zero percent interest rates would unleash devastating #inflation. cutting rates was the problem. raising rates exposed the problem.

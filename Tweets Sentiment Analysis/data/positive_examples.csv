PeterSchiff,5/19/22,886629,,1045,"safe haven buying in the swiss franc and japanese yen over the past two days, plus the rise in the price of #gold, could indicate markets are beginning to wake up to the reality that the u.s. economy is already in #recession and the #fed will ease policy despite high #inflation."
PeterSchiff,6/27/22,886611,,1007,busts are usually proportionate to the artificial booms that precede them. we had a financial crisis in 2008 and great #recession because the boom the #fed created with 1% interest rates for about two years was so large. imagine what follows 0% interest rates for nearly 14 years!
PeterSchiff,8/3/22,886577,,978,"the yield on a one-year treasury bill now exceeds the yield on a 30-year u.s. treasury bond. that not only confirms #recession, but that investors are confident that #inflation will return to 2% and stay there for 30 years. bond yields will soar once investors realize the truth."
PeterSchiff,4/12/22,886636,,827,"the yield curve is no longer inverted at any point. 5s are higher than 2s, 10s are higher than 5s &amp; 30s are higher than 10s, with 30s the only maturity higher on the day. this means investors are pricing in a #recession starting sooner and #inflation lasting longer. #stagflation!"
